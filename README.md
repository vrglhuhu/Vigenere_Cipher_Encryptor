_I am Chean Bernard V. Vergel.  I am 18 years old and currently I am a first year college student taking my Bachelors' degree in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines.  I believe that technology is something that has completely changed the way we live today and I am excited to be part of this ever-evolving world.  A famous quote I always like to keep in mind is "The only way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln._
